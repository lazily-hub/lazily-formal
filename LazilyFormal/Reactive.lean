! Reactive graph kernel — formal model.

The flat reactive core shared by every lazily binding (`lazily-rs`,
`lazily-py`, `lazily-zig`, `lazily-kt`, `lazily-js`, `lazily-dart`). It models
the **Cell kernel** — `Cell` is the value-bearing node concept, and its two
kinds are the `source` cell (handle `Source<T, M>`) and the `computed` cell
(handle `Computed<T>`), plus the value-less `effect` sink. (v2 naming: there is
no `Cell<T, K>` genus handle — `Cell` names the concept, `Source`/`Computed` are
the concrete handles.) Documented in `lazily-spec/docs/reactive-graph.md` and
implemented in `lazily-rs/src/{context,slot,cell,signal,effect}.rs`. An eager
value is a *driven* `computed` (`computed().eager()`), not a fourth kind.

This is the formal counterpart of the *behavioral core* of the reactive graph:

- the closed node-kind partition (source / computed / effect — no `Signal` kind),
- the reverse subscription edge set (`source → its direct dependents`),
- the `PartialEq` source-write guard,
- the computed-equality suppression guard (computed cells are guarded by default), and
- the eager (driven-computed) materialization invariant.

Like the `StateMachine` kernel, this is the layer whose state changes surface
on the lazily-spec IPC wire as `CellSet` / `SlotValue` / `Invalidate` ops (the
wire names are unchanged by the kernel rename — a slot is the storage position
that holds a node); the wire linkage itself stays in `lazily-spec`. The model
fixes *behavior*, not wire encoding — values are abstract `Nat` stand-ins,
exactly like the rest of `LazilyFormal`.

Proved here:

- `setCell_equal_preserves_graph` — the `PartialEq` source-write guard: an equal
  write leaves the whole graph byte-identical (no churn, no downstream
  invalidation). Universal form of the wire-level "equal `set` emits no
  `CellSet` and no downstream ops" invariant.
- `setCell_different_invalidates_dependents` — a strictly-different write marks
  every direct dependent dirty.
- `recomputeSlot_equal_preserves_dependents` — the computed guard: a `computed`
  that recomputes with its guard returning `true` leaves every *downstream*
  dependent untouched. (The `Slot` in the identifier is the storage sense.)
- `recomputeSlot_different_invalidates_dependents` — a strictly-different
  recompute marks every direct dependent dirty.
- `signal_materialized_after_recompute` — a driven `computed`'s backing node is
  always materialized after the puller runs (no observable "unset" intermediate
  state). A driven computed = `computed` + puller `effect` (`computed().eager()`);
  universal form of the wire-level "changed eager value emits `SlotValue`, never
  bare `Invalidate` for its backing node" invariant.
- `disposeScope_eq_disposeAll` and friends — explicit disposal detaches edges in
  *both* directions, and ending a teardown scope (`scope()`) is observationally
  equal to disposing each member individually. See § "Disposal and teardown
  scopes" below.
- `hybrid_serves_stale_value_at_depth_two` — eager cone marking and lazy pull
  are each sound, but *combining* one-level marking with a cache-trusting read
  loses writes at depth 2. A shipped defect in two bindings, reduced to three
  nodes. See § "Staleness discovery" below.

The guards are total functions of `(graph, node, value)`, so the
"no churn on equal" guarantee is by construction — but the theorems make it
*observable* as graph-equality / dirty-flag statements, the property no finite
fixture suite can establish.

/-! ## The Cell kernel partition (`#lzcellkernel`)

The node enumeration is closed: every reactive node is a `source`, a `computed`,
an `effect`, or `disposed`. There is no `Signal` kind — an eager value is a driven
`computed` (a `computed` paired with a puller `effect`), not a fourth constructor.
The value-bearing kinds `source`/`computed` are the two kinds of `Cell` (value
from outside vs. from upstream), surfaced as the `Source`/`Computed` handles;
`effect` is the value-less sink. (v2: `Cell` is the concept, not a `Cell<T, K>`
genus handle.) This section is `lazily-cell-kernel-design.md` §1, §9.2.2, and §3 rendered
as proofs — the design asks the formal model to *confirm these are expressible*. -/

The `ComputedCell` recompute primitive (`lazily-rs`: `ctx.computed` /

guarantee that surfaces on the wire as "an equal computed recompute emits no
`SlotValue` and no downstream `Invalidate`". (`recomputeSlot` keeps its name — the
`Slot` is the storage position the computed node occupies.) -/

/-- `recomputeSlot g id newVal`: clear `id`'s dirty flag and cache `newVal`.

/-! ### `computed_ripple_when` — the custom propagate guard

`memoEq` is an **arbitrary** `Value → Value → Bool`, so the two theorems above
already characterise every kind of guard the surface exposes — they never assume
`memoEq` is `(· = ·)`:

* `computed(f)` installs `memoEq = (· = ·)` (natural equality).
* `computed_ripple_when(f, changed)`
  (`lazily-rs/src/context.rs`, `Context::computed_ripple_when`) installs
  `memoEq = fun old new => ¬ changed old new` — the guard **suppresses** exactly
  when the value did **not** meaningfully change, i.e. propagates iff
  `changed old new`.
* `slot(f)` installs `memoEq = none` (pass-through): `suppressed` is always
  `false`, so `recomputeSlot_different_invalidates_dependents` applies on every
  recompute — it always propagates.

This is the model's evidence that `computed_ripple_when` is a **propagate**
guard, never a compute guard: `recomputeSlot` *receives* `newVal` (the compute
already ran; the predicate needs `new`), and the guard only governs whether the
dependents are marked dirty. `changed` MUST be pure in `(old, new)`; value-carried
state (a version/counter field) is a fine input and keeps the recompute
deterministic. -/

/-- `computed_ripple_when` suppression, stated directly: with the guard
    `memoEq = fun o n => ¬ changed o n`, a recompute whose `changed old newVal`
    is `false` leaves every downstream dependent (`d ≠ id`) untouched. A thin

/-! ## Driven computed — eager materialization

A *driven* `computed` (`computed().eager()`, `lazily-rs/src/signal.rs`) is a
`computed` paired with a puller `effect` that re-materializes it immediately after
every invalidation. The universal observable property is that a reader never
observes an unset intermediate state: after the puller runs, the value is
concrete. This is the formal form of the wire-level "changed eager value emits
`SlotValue`, never a bare `Invalidate` for its backing node" invariant.

This is the *graph* half of the claim, and it is all this kernel can state:
`recomputeSlot` receives the new value from its caller, so the model has no notion
of *running* a computation and therefore cannot say that the puller changes only
the timing of compute, nor how many times compute ran. `LazilyFormal.Signal`
re-models the driven computed at that resolution — compute as a function of the
sources, with its invocations counted — and proves the two properties this
section cannot reach: `signal_read_equiv_lazy_memo` (a driven computed and a bare
lazy computed agree on every read under every program) and
`batch_pull_runs_at_most_once` (N batched writes cost one pull, not N). -/

/-- Run the puller: recompute the backing computed to `newVal`. By construction the
    puller runs *immediately* after invalidation (it is itself a dependent
    `effect`), so after [`signalPull`] the backing computed is materialized
    regardless of whether the value changed. -/
def signalPull (g : Graph) (slotId : NodeId) (newVal : Value) : Graph :=

/-- After the puller runs, the backing computed carries a concrete cached
    value (no `none` / unset intermediate) and is not dirty. This is the

/-! ## Disposal and teardown scopes

Explicit teardown (`lazily-rs/src/context.rs`: `Context::dispose_slot`,
`Context::dispose_cell`, `Context::scope` / `TeardownScope`), specified in
`lazily-spec/docs/reactive-graph.md` § "Lifecycle".

Handles are copyable ids, not owners, so dropping every handle to a node
reclaims nothing: without an explicit disposal call the node and its edge on
each dependency survive for the life of the context — unbounded growth in both
memory and propagation cost under subscribe/unsubscribe churn. The model
therefore makes disposal a *graph* operation, not a refcount:

- **Both directions.** `disposeNode` clears the node's own reverse-edge list
  (nothing is subscribed to a dead node) *and* removes it from every other
  node's list (a dead node is subscribed to nothing). Modeling only one
  direction would leave exactly the leak the runtime's
  `remove_dependent_edges_locked` / `remove_dependency_edges_locked` pair
  exists to close.
- **Reading a disposed node is an error.** Modeled by the `.disposed` kind with
  no value: there is no value to observe, so any law phrased over
  `.value = some _` is simply unavailable at a disposed id. The model does not
  encode the *throw*; it fixes the observable state that makes reading
  meaningless.
- **A teardown scope is a set and a moment, nothing more.** `Scope` records the
  ids created through it (`TeardownScope.owned`), and `disposeScope` tears the
  whole set down in one pass. The load-bearing theorem is
  [`disposeScope_eq_disposeAll`]: that one pass is *observationally equal* to
  disposing each member individually, so a scope can introduce no disposal
  semantics of its own. Scoping bounds teardown, **not visibility** — the
  model needs no visibility construct to say so, because reads in this model are
  plain `Graph.node` lookups unrestricted by scope, exactly matching "a scope's
  nodes read parent-owned or sibling-owned nodes freely".
- **The scope hazard is the single-disposal hazard.** Since scope teardown *is*
  the fold of single disposals, it inherits the caveat verbatim: ending a scope
  tears down its nodes even if something outside still reads them.

- `disposeNode_idempotent` — disposing twice equals disposing once.
- `disposeScope_eq_disposeAll` — scope teardown equals the fold of individual
  disposals (cited by name from `lazily-spec/docs/reactive-graph.md`).
- `disposeAll_preserves_nonmember_node` / `disposeAll_preserves_nonmembers` —
  a node outside the scope keeps its state and its dirty flag.
- `disposeAll_order_independent` — teardown does not depend on the order the
  scope recorded its members.
- `disposeNode_recycled_id_inherits_nothing` — a re-minted node at a disposed
  id starts with an empty reverse-edge set. `dispose_slot` pushes the id onto
  `free_ids`, so a later `computed`/`cell` can land on it; without the edge
  detach above, the fresh node would alias a stale index and inherit
  invalidations meant for its dead predecessor. -/

/-- **Scope teardown equals the fold of individual disposals.**

    Ending a teardown scope is observationally equal to disposing each of its
    members one at a time: the graphs are identical, node for node and edge for
    edge. A scope therefore introduces *no disposal semantics of its own* — it
    names a set and a moment, and nothing else. Two consequences the spec leans
    on: a scope cannot be safer than single disposal (it inherits the "tears
    down nodes something outside may still read" hazard verbatim), and a binding
    may implement `scope()` as a recorded id list plus a teardown loop without
    changing observable behavior.

/-! ## Staleness discovery: why the hybrid strategy is unsound

Two strategies for making a write observable at transitive depth are both
*correct*, and the family permits either:

- **Eager marking** — a write walks the whole dependent cone and marks every
  transitive node dirty. Reads then trust the flag.
- **Lazy pull** — a write marks little or nothing, and every read refreshes its
  own dependencies recursively before deciding whether to recompute. This is the
  strategy `reactive-graph.md` describes: "On `get`, a computed first refreshes its
  own dependencies (recursively, lazy pull), then recomputes only if any
  dependency actually changed."

`setCell` above implements the second: it marks only *direct* dependents, which
is sufficient precisely because a read is expected to recurse. That is not an
incompleteness in this model — it is the lazy strategy, stated.

**The unsound combination is the hybrid**: mark one level eagerly, *and* let
reads short-circuit on a clean node. Each half is fine; together they lose
writes at depth 2 and beyond, because the mark never reaches the node and the
read never looks past it.

This is not hypothetical. It shipped in two bindings and was found on
2026-07-19 (`lazily-dart` `c91a32a`, `lazily-go` `bdfdbce`). Both tracked async
slot staleness with a revision counter and a `Resolved` state whose read path
returned the cached value directly, while their invalidation handler notified
only the written cell's immediate dependents. A chain `cell -> a -> b` served a
stale `b` indefinitely. The theorem below is that failure, reduced to three
nodes. -/

/-- A read that trusts the dirty flag and does **not** refresh dependencies:
    a clean node serves its cached value. This is the short-circuiting half of
    the hybrid — `AsyncSlotResolved` in `lazily-go`, `AsyncSlotState.resolved`
    in `lazily-dart`. -/

  if (g.node id).dirty then none else (g.node id).value

/-- A three-node chain `0 -> 1 -> 2`: a source cell, a computed reading it, and a
    computed reading that computed. Values are seeded consistently with `src = v`. -/
def chain (v : Value) : Graph :=
  { node := fun n =>
      if n = 0 then ⟨.source, some v, none, false⟩
      else if n = 1 then ⟨.computed, some (v + 10), none, false⟩
      else if n = 2 then ⟨.computed, some (v + 110), none, false⟩
      else ⟨.disposed, none, none, false⟩
  , dependents := fun n =>
      if n = 0 then [1] else if n = 1 then [2] else [] }

    (((setCell (chain 1) 0 2).node 1).dirty) = true := by

theorem chain_setCell_leaves_depth_two_clean :
    (((setCell (chain 1) 0 2).node 2).dirty) = false := by
  decide

/-- **The hybrid loses the write.** After a source write, a cache-trusting read
    of the depth-2 node returns the value computed from the *old* source — the
    graph reports `111`, derived from `src = 1`, when `src` is now `2` and the
    consistent answer is `112`.

    This is the whole defect. Under lazy pull the same graph is correct, because
    the read of node 2 would refresh node 1 first and observe the change; under
    eager cone marking it is correct, because node 2 would carry the dirty flag.
    Combining "mark one level" with "trust the flag" is what loses the write, and
    neither half looks wrong in isolation — which is why this shipped twice. -/

    read must recompute rather than answering from cache. -/
