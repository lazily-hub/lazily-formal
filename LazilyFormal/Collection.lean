! Keyed reactive collections — formal model.

The formal counterpart of `lazily-rs/src/cell_family.rs` (`CellMap` / `SlotMap`,
the `ReactiveMap<K, V, H>` specializations) and the `lazily-spec/cell-model.md`
§ "Keyed cell collections" specification. `CellMap` is a hash collection whose
**membership is itself reactive**, with one independently-tracked value cell per
entry; `get_or_insert_with` (the shared `ReactiveMap` method) lazily mints and
caches one entry per key on first access.

The universal properties fixed here (no finite fixture suite can establish
them):

- **Three independent reactive signals**: per-entry value, set-membership, and
  order. The model fixes the wire-level "a pure reorder (`move_to`) MUST NOT
  invalidate set-membership readers (`len` / `contains`)" invariant and its
  duals.
- **Atomic move preserves identity**: a reorder keeps each entry's cell
  identity (not remove + re-mint), bumping only the order signal once.
- **`get_or_insert_with` memoizes per key**: requesting the same key twice
  returns the same cell (identity stability across the factory).

These are the "value, set-membership, and order reactivity are independent"
conformance clauses of `cell-model.md`, restated as Lean theorems over an
abstract `Collection` state.

/-- Abstract key for a collection entry (a `K` in `lazily-rs`). -/
abbrev Key := Nat

/-- Abstract per-entry value. The model exercises equality and identity. -/
abbrev EntryValue := Nat

/-- The state of one keyed reactive collection (`CellMap`).

The three independent reactive signals are modeled explicitly as monotonic
version counters, mirroring `lazily-rs`'s `membership` and `order_signal`
cells (`src/cell_family.rs`):

- `values` — per-key value cells (independently tracked).
- `membershipV` — the set-membership version; bumped on `add`/`remove` only.
- `orderV` — the order version; bumped on `add`/`remove` **and** on `move`.

A reader of `len`/`contains` subscribes to `membershipV`; a reader of `keys`
subscribes to `orderV`; a reader of `get k` subscribes to `values[k]` alone. -/

  /-- Insertion-ordered authoritative key list. -/

/-! ## Mutators

Each mutator returns the resulting collection. The version-counter deltas make
the independence laws mechanical: `setEntryValue` touches neither version;
`addKey`/`removeKey` bump both; `moveKey` bumps only `orderV`. -/

/-- Update the value cell at `k` (which must be a member). Leaves membership
    and order signals untouched. -/
def setEntryValue (c : Collection) (k : Key) (v : EntryValue) : Collection :=
  { c with values := fun j => if j = k then some v else c.values j }

/-- Insert `k` as a new member at the end, minting its value cell. Bumps both
    the membership and the order signal. (No-op if `k` is already a member.) -/

    signal. (No-op if `k` is not a member.) -/

                      orderV := c.orderV + 1 }
  | false => c

/-- A pure reorder: move `k` to position `i`. Bumps **only** the order signal;
    membership and every entry's value cell are untouched. This is the formal
    counterpart of `lazily-rs`'s `CellMap::move_to` (`#lzcellmove`). -/
def moveKey (c : Collection) (k : Key) (i : Nat) : Collection :=
  match c.order.contains k with
  | true => { c with order := (c.order.filter (fun j => j ≠ k)).insertIdx
                       (min i c.order.length - 1) k,

/-! ## ReactiveMap `get_or_insert_with` — per-key memoization

`ReactiveMap::get_or_insert_with` (`lazily-rs/src/cell_family.rs:315`) is the
shared keyed-map factory: it lazily mints and caches one entry per key on first
access (`SlotMap` uses it for lazy materialization). The universal guarantee is
identity stability — the same key resolves to the same handle across requests. -/
